config.json
# Keep config.json if it serves as a template, but usually we ignore personal configs.
# However, the repo provided a config.json. Let's keep it tracked if it's the "default".
# If user wants to track default, Keep it. If users override it locally, they should use a copy.
# Given it's a template for now, let's NOT ignore config.json, but user can change this policy.
# playlists.json is deleted so no need to ignore.
